## Additional Notes
Design Challenges
The original design included icons that I couldn't locate, so I replaced them with Google Icons (free and widely available).
The specified font was also unavailable, so I selected a visually similar alternative. This may result in slight differences in size or properties such as boldness.
Tools & Libraries
I primarily prefer vanilla CSS for styling. However, to meet the time constraints:
Switch Component: Implemented using Material-UI.
Graphs: Created using Chart.js.
All other components were handcrafted and styled by me.
Data Handling
Understanding the data and its relationships posed a significant challenge due to the complexity of the subject matter.
To streamline development, I created a custom JSON file, data.json, located within the project files. This avoided reliance on an API and simplified the implementation process.
Styling & Architecture
Used the provider pattern for state and data sharing between components.
Styling was done using SASS modules to ensure modularity and maintainability.
Responsive Design
Focused on maintaining design consistency across various breakpoints.
üìù Final Thoughts
While there is room for improvement, I aimed to deliver a design-consistent and functional project within the given constraints. I hope the result meets your expectations, and I look forward to discussing it with you soon.
